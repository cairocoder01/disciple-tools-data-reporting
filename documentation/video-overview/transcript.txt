The Data Reporting plugin was created to automate the export of Disciple Tools data to cloud-based data storage for more advanced reporting features than are available in the in-app metrics. It is different from other metrics plugins in that it exports all individual posts and post activity so that you can report on non-aggregated data. All personally-identifiable information is stripped from contact records to protect the data while in transit. Exports include all custom fields that have been configured and also include a site column with the URL of your site so that you can store the data for multiple sites in a single database table.

To get started, you can manually download the data for any post type from the Manual Export tab. Both CSV and JSON formats are available depending on your needs.

To automate your exports, create a configuration from the Settings tab. Just name your config, choose which provider to use to send the data to your cloud provider, and choose which post types should be exported. A generic API provider is available by default, or extra providers can be installed with the provider plugins for Google and Amazon cloud platforms.

For plugin developers, you can create an export configuration via WordPress hooks so that your users only have to install a plugin in order to export data to your cloud data storage. Data can be filtered down to just the subset that is required for your reporting.
